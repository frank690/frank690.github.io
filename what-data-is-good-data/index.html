                                    <p>What data do you need to train your machine learning (ML) model? What requirements need to be fulfilled to consider data good? What are some counterexamples? In this post, I want to answer these questions.</p><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Good data has to fulfill multiple requirements. Firstly, it needs to have a pattern that solves the problem you want to tackle. Secondly, the quality of the data needs to be high enough. Thirdly, the amount of data you have needs to be sufficient (but generally speaking: having more data is always good). </p><p>As stated <a href="../what-is-learning.html">before</a>, ML helps you to find a (to you unknown) function/pattern within your data. For your data to be "good data" it has to fulfill some requirements. </p><h3 id="good-data-needs-a-pattern-within">Good data needs a pattern within</h3><p>First and foremost your data has to contain a pattern that is related to the problem you want to solve. If there is no pattern at all, you are out of luck. But how can you know if there is a pattern within your data? It depends on the kind of task you want to solve. Let me give you some quick examples.</p><h4 id="example-1-counting-trucks">Example 1: Counting trucks</h4><p>You are given the task to write an algorithm that counts the number of trucks that are passing by a certain part of a highway. What is good data? Good data would for example be a camera that records the traffic and which you could use to find a pattern of what a truck looks like. If you would find one, you could just use that pattern to automatically count a truck as soon as it is recorded by the camera. What is bad data? Bad data would for example be the course of hundreds of thousands of games of chess that top-level players played. In such data, you would hardly find a pattern that can predict the number of trucks that are passing by a certain point on a highway, and therefore it is bad data (for the task you want to solve).</p><h4 id="example-2-playing-games">Example 2: Playing Games</h4><p>You are given the task to write an algorithm that can beat world-class players (humans) in their favorite game (e.g. GO, Chess, Dota, ...).  What data is good data? Good data would be the course of hundreds of thousands of games, including each move that was made at what time, the results of that move, and information about who won and who lost. What is bad data? Bad data would be a (live) stream of a traffic camera that just shows a highway and the vehicles passing by because your algorithm would most likely not figure out how to play chess just by looking at the traffic (jams) on a highway.</p><p>In the examples I just presented to you, it is quite obvious that the bad data is actually bad because it has no relation to the task/problem you want to solve. But this is typically not the case.</p><h4 id="example-3-machine-health">Example 3: Machine Health</h4><p>You are employed by a company that uses drop-forges to produce various car parts. These machines need to be continuously maintained in order to keep them functioning well. Your task is to train an ML model to predict the current health of the machine to adjust the frequency of the maintenance cycle. A lower maintenance frequency results in a lower machine downtime (which equals more productivity) but it increases the risk of the machine breaking and vice versa. A single drop forge is equipped with various sensors measuring a big variety of signals (e.g. motor currents, temperatures, pressures, speeds, frequencies, number of parts forges, ...). What signals (data) should you use to correctly predict the current health of the machine? Maybe all of them have a hidden relationship with the health state of the machine. Maybe just some. Or maybe even none of them. Figuring out questions like this is rarely a trivial task, but it is most definitely a part of the process of developing an ML solution to your problem.</p><h3 id="good-data-needs-quality">Good data needs quality</h3><p>In the "Counting Trucks" example, the camera that provides the data of the traffic for you, could have a dirty lens or be blinded by the sun at certain times of the day. Thus, drastically reducing the <strong>quality</strong> of your data until the point that you can hardly distinguish or recognize vehicles, at all. In the "machine health" example, the various signals may not be in perfect time synchronization, or the electrical field of a power cable might interfere with some analog signals of other cables nearby. What I want to illustrate with these examples is, that rarely any data is perfect. Especially data that is recorded by any kind of (real world) sensor can be falsified by a variety of things. In the majority of problems you have to solve as a data scientist, you will not have the opportunity to make a wish for a new sensor or a new signal (and wait until you have collected enough data). You are simply left to work with what you got in the first place. In order to get the best quality out of your given data, preprocessing is the key. <em>"For most practical applications, the original input variables are typically preprocessed to transform them into some new space of variables where it is hoped, the pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve.<em>"</em></em> [CMB]</p><h3 id="good-data-needs-disk-space">Good data needs disk space</h3><p>For your (supervised) ML algorithm to learn/find a pattern, you need a sufficient amount of data that it can learn from. Imagine your algorithm wants to learn how to play chess (and do that on a super-human skill level), but you only have data of a single match that it can learn from. Even if that single match has a good quality (e.g. the players are highly skilled and the data has no errors), your model would still just have learned a single opening followed by a few strategies the players applied according to what moves their counterparts performed. The vast majority of what strategies a player needs to know to play on a world-class level would just be completely unknown to your model because it never saw them (at least in classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning">supervised learning</a>). This analogy can be extended to the problem you want to solve, but in general, one can say two things. First, having more data is better than not having more data. Second, the harder your problem is, the more data you probably need to solve it.</p><h3 id="acronyms">Acronyms</h3><p>ML - Machine Learning</p><h3 id="sources">Sources</h3><p>[CMB] - Pattern recognition and machine learning, Christopher M.
